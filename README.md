## 🛡️ Security & Sigma Rules

LogWard goes beyond simple monitoring by transforming your logs into a security advantage. We support **Sigma Rules**, the industry-standard format for describing log signatures.

* **Threat Detection:** Automatically detect suspicious activities (e.g., SSH brute force, clearing of history, web shells).
* **Standard Format:** Write rules in standard YAML or import existing ones from the [Sigma community](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma).
* **Real-time Matching:** Rules are evaluated against incoming logs in real-time.

**Example Rule (Detecting History Clear):**

```yaml
title: Clear Command History
status: stable
logsource:
    product: linux
detection:
    selection:
        command:
            - 'history -c'
            - 'cat /dev/null > ~/.bash_history'
    condition: selection
level: high
```
